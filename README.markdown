## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem enhanced with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from satellite imagery (TIFF files). It models the interactions between herbivores (prey) and carnivores (predators) in a grid-based environment where vegetation growth influences herbivore behavior. The simulation incorporates optional Reinforcement Learning (RL) for herbivores, allowing them to learn optimal movement strategies based on NDVI values and energy management.

The core simulation is built in Python using scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. A user-friendly web interface, powered by FastAPI, enables interactive configuration, real-time visualization, and result analysis. This project demonstrates advanced concepts in ecological modeling, agent-based simulation, reinforcement learning, and web development.
